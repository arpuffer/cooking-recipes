# No-Knead Bread, Same Day

Ingredients:
* 3 cups flour
* 1/4tsp active dry yeast
* 1tsp salt



Steps:
1. In a large bowl, mix dry ingredients
2. Add 1.5 cups of hot water (130deg C Max) and mix into a shaggy dough
3. Cover and allow to rest for 3hr (timing has a pretty big margin here)
4. Dough should be ~2x the size and fairly soft, with bubbles visible on the top.
5. Place dough on well-floured surface--it will be very sticky, but should still retain its shape.
6. Sprinkle flour over the top of the dough and use a scraper to fold the dough over on itself a few times and shape into a round.  About 10-15 turns here.
7. Place in a parchment paper lined bowl, cover w/towel
8. Preheat oven (with dutch oven inside) to 450deg F
9. By holding the parchment paper, lift dough out of the bowl and place (paper and all) into the hot dutch oven.
10. Bake 30mins
11. Remove lid, unwrap the parchment paper, place back in the oven for 15mins
