Prăjitură Turnată Cu Mere (Jammy Apple Bars)

Ingredients
Yield:1 (9-inch square) pastry/16 bites

    8 medium Honeycrisp apples or another sweet and tart variety (about 4 pounds)

    ½ cup/100 grams plus ⅓ cup/66 grams granulated sugar

    1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

    2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided

    ¼ cup/50 grams sunflower seed oil (or other neutral oil), plus more for brushing

    ¾ cup/95 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting 

    2 large eggs

    ⅛ teaspoon fine salt

    ½ teaspoon baking powder 

    ¼ cup/52 grams whole milk

    Powdered sugar, for dusting



Preparation

    Step 1

    Peel the apples. In a large pot, grate the apples using the coarse side of a box grater. Add ½ cup/100 grams granulated sugar and place the pot over high heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated and the apples have softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the cinnamon and 1 teaspoon vanilla; set aside to cool. 
    Step 2

    Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly brush a 9-inch square baking pan with oil and line with parchment paper. Brush the parchment paper with a bit of oil and add a bit of flour. Shake the pan to evenly coat the parchment paper with flour, then tap out the excess over the sink. 
    Step 3

    In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, remaining ⅓ cup/66 grams granulated sugar and salt. Using an electric mixer (or stand mixer with the whisk attachment), whip the eggs, gradually increasing the speed, for about 3 minutes, until they become fluffy and reach a pale yellow color. 
    Step 4

    With the mixer running, slowly stream the oil to emulsify. 
    Step 5

    In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder. Add half of the flour to the egg mixture and beat until incorporated. Add the milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla and beat until incorporated. Add the remaining flour and mix until incorporated. 
    Step 6

    Pour 1 cup batter into the baking pan. Bake for 15 minutes, until the top looks golden and the cake is springy to the touch. 
    Step 7

    Using a spoon or an ice cream scoop, dollop the apple mixture on top of the baked cake in an even layer. Using an offset spatula, evenly spread the apple mixture until it reaches the sides of the pan. 
    Step 8

    Drizzle the remaining batter on top of the apple layer in an even layer. Tilt the pan, if needed, so the batter reaches the sides of the pan. Return to the oven and bake for 40 minutes, until the top is springy to the touch and has a golden brown color. If the top browns too quickly, cover the pan with a sheet of aluminum foil.
    Step 9

    Cool in the pan until room temperature, then carefully lift the cake using the parchment and transfer to a cutting board; slice into 16 pieces. Dust with powdered sugar to serve.
