Ingredients
Yield:Makes 8 to 10 servings

    ½cup/105 grams extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan
    4ounces/115 grams white chocolate, chopped or broken into small pieces 
    5large eggs
    1cup/190 grams granulated sugar
    ⅔cup/145 grams full-fat plain yogurt (not Greek; see Tip)
    Zest of 2 medium lemons, preferably organic
    3tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from one of the zested lemons)
    ¾teaspoon vanilla extract
    1cup/100 grams almond flour
    1½teaspoons baking powder
    ½teaspoon fine sea salt
    Pinch ground nutmeg
    1cup/140 grams all-purpose flour
    Powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)

Preparation

    Step 1
    Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Lightly grease a 9-inch round metal cake pan with olive oil and line the bottom with a round of parchment paper.
    
    Step 2
    Add the white chocolate to a large, oven-safe mixing bowl (or metal stand-mixer bowl, if you’ll use a stand mixer), place it in the oven and set the oven to 325 degrees (the gradually warming oven will gently melt the chocolate). Check on the white chocolate every 1 to 2 minutes, prodding it with a whisk to determine whether it has melted; it should take 3 to 5 minutes in total. (Alternatively, microwave the white chocolate in a large microwave-safe bowl at 50 percent power, stirring at 15-second intervals, until melted. Heat the oven to 325 degrees for use in Step 6.)
    
    Step 3
    As soon as the chocolate is completely melted, remove it from the oven (the bowl will be hot!) and whisk it gently to make sure it’s perfectly smooth (If it’s not, let the residual heat of the melted chocolate melt any tiny solid bits, or briefly return the bowl to the oven to finish the job).
    
    Step 4
    Let the bowl cool until just warm. Add the olive oil to the white chocolate and whisk until well combined. (An electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment will also work.) Add the eggs and mix well. Whisk in the sugar, yogurt, lemon zest, lemon juice and vanilla until well combined. Add the almond flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg to the bowl. Give it a good whisking to make it very smooth.
    
    Step 5
    Finally, add the all-purpose flour and gently whisk just until the batter is evenly mixed with no lumps remaining. Use a flexible spatula to give it a final gentle mix, making sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. Tap the bowl a few times on the countertop to eliminate large air bubbles.
    
    Step 6
    Scrape the batter into the prepared cake pan and tap the pan on the countertop to force out more air bubbles. Bake until golden brown and a cake tester comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes.
    
    Step 7
    Let the pan cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then run a table knife around the edge of the cake pan to loosen the cake. Invert the cake onto a large plate, remove the pan and invert the bare cake back onto the cooling rack to cool at least 30 minutes more. When ready to serve, use a sieve to dust it lightly with powdered sugar, if you wish. Serve warm or at room temperature. When completely cooled, store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.

Tip

    If you already have Greek yogurt, combine ½ cup (115 grams) of it with 2 tablespoons of water in place of the unstrained yogurt.
