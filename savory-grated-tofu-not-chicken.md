Ingredients
Yield:4 servings 

    1 to 1½cups/190 to 285 grams uncooked white or brown rice (or 3 to 4½ cups/425 to 650 grams cooked white or brown rice)
    For the Tofu
        1(10- to 12-ounce/280- to 340-gram) package super-firm tofu (see Tip)
        1½tablespoons neutral-flavored oil of choice
        4scallions, sliced at an angle (reserve dark green tops for garnish)
        1 to 2Thai chiles (or 1 small serrano pepper), thinly sliced (optional, for spicy!)
        3garlic cloves, thinly sliced
        1tablespoon roasted black or white sesame seeds
    For the Sauce
        3tablespoons/52 grams tamari or soy sauce
        1tablespoon Chinese black vinegar (see Tip for a gluten-free substitute)
        1teaspoon organic cane sugar, pure maple syrup or agave nectar
        1tablespoon gochugaru (Korean chile flakes); see Tip
        1tablespoon toasted sesame oil
    For Serving
        1handful cilantro leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped

Preparation

    Step 1

    Start by cooking the rice using your preferred method, or get out your leftover cooked rice.
    Step 2

    Make the tofu: Wrap the tofu in a thin dish towel and gently squeeze with your palms to remove some water but don’t squish it. Using the large holes of a box grater, grate the tofu. If small pieces break off, slice them very thinly.
    Step 3

    In a large nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. After a minute or two, add the scallions, chiles (if using) and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is slightly golden and the scallions are softened, about 2 minutes.
    Step 4

    Add the grated tofu to the pan and toss to coat it in the oil. Cook undisturbed for 2 minutes, then stir. Cook, stirring every 2 minutes, until the tofu is golden brown in some spots, a total of 10 to 14 minutes.
    Step 5

    Meanwhile, make the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the tamari, vinegar, sugar, gochugaru and sesame oil until well combined.
    Step 6

    Pour the sauce into the pan — it will bubble rapidly — and stir with a silicone spatula to evenly coat the tofu. Cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and sprinkle with the sesame seeds.
    Step 7

    Serve over cooked rice and top with the reserved scallion tops and cilantro. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 4 to 5 days.

Tips

    Super-firm tofu or “high-protein” tofu makes for a very convincing meat substitute, but if you don’t have it, use extra-firm tofu and press for 10 minutes; grate the tofu, then dab with towels to remove water. Don’t have gochugaru? Sub with 1 to 1½ teaspoons of Sichuan chile flakes or sriracha.
    Most Chinese black vinegar is fermented with grains. Substitute 2 parts rice vinegar to 1 part aged balsamic vinegar.
