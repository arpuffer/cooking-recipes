# Ingredients

* 1.5g Gentian
* 1.5g Wormwood
* 0.3g Dried Chamomile Flowers
* 1.2 g Juniper Berries
* 1 g Vanilla Pod
* 1.4g Star Anise
* 0.5g Ground Sage
* 3.5g Dried Orange Peel
* 0.4g Cardamom Pod
* 1g Coriander Seed
* 240ml Vodka 40%
* 1 bottle (750ml) Sauvignon Blanc
* 1:1 simple syrup (by weight) to taste

# Instructions
Steep herbs in vodka for 24hrs+ (to taste) in a large glass vessel. Add the wine, and steep for another 24hrs+. Once desired potency is achieved, strain, filter, and bottle. I made a 'dry style' so I added about 2 tbsp of simple syrup. Without any syrup, the vermouth was too dry for me to enjoy on ice with a lemon zest.
