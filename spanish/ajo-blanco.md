# Ajo Blanco


### Tested size: 6 servings; makes 4 cups

## INGREDIENTS
* ~ 5 ounces day-old bread (crusts removed), cubed (2 1/2 cups)
* 1 cup slivered almonds
* 2 medium garlic cloves, chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or more as needed
* 1 1/2 cups cold water, or more as needed
* 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 1/2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, preferably aged, or more as needed
* 2 cups lightly packed baby lettuces, preferably of different colors, for serving
* 1/2 cup chive blossoms or other edible ï¬‚owers, broken into petals, for serving
* 1 cup sweet cherries, pitted and halved, for serving
* 1/4 cup sliced almonds, toasted, for serving

## DIRECTIONS
* Place the bread in a mixing bowl and add enough cold water to cover. Soak for 5 to 10 minutes and then drain, squeezing out the excess liquid. Transfer the soaked bread to a blender.

* Add the almonds, garlic, salt and 1 cup of the water to the blender; puree until a smooth paste forms. With the blender running at the highest speed, drizzle the oil through the feed tube to form an emulsified mixture. Add the vinegar and the remaining 1/2 cup water, blending briefly.

* Check the consistency of the soup; it should be like very thick cream or very thin mayonnaise. Add more water, as needed, to thin it out slightly. Taste for seasoning, and add more vinegar and/or salt, as needed.

* Transfer the soup to a pitcher. It will be delicious if you serve right away. If you have time, refrigerate it, covered, for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to develop.

* To serve, pile a small heap of the lettuce at the center of each individual bowl. Top each heap with flower petals, cherries and a sprinkle of the toasted almonds. Bring the pitcher to the table and pour the soup around the garnish in each bowl.

NOTE: To toast the almonds, place the almonds in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until they are golden and fragrant. Transfer to a plate to cool.
