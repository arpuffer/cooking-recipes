Ingredients (Serves 4)

    Sichuan Peppercorns: 2 tablespoons (divided use)
    Neutral Oil (e.g. vegetable oil): 2 tablespoons (plus extra if needed)
    Beef Cheeks (or other braising cuts, e.g. short ribs, brisket): 1 kg
    Fresh Ginger: 20 g, peeled and grated
    Garlic: 4 cloves, crushed
    Scallions: 2–3, finely chopped (white parts for cooking, green parts reserved for garnish)
    Doubanjiang (Sichuan fermented chilli bean paste): 2 tablespoons
    Fermented Black Beans (Douchi): 1 tablespoon, rinsed if very salty and lightly mashed
    Chilli Powder: 1 tablespoon (adjust to taste)
    Plain Flour (all-purpose): 2 tablespoons
    Light Soy Sauce: 1 tablespoon
    Dark Soy Sauce: 1 tablespoon
    Shaoxing Wine (or dry sherry): 2 tablespoons
    Water or Stock: ~800 ml total (added gradually; you may need more or less)
    Chinese Black Rice Vinegar (or balsamic): 1 teaspoon (optional, for balancing)
    Salt (optional): to taste


Method
1. Place 2 tablespoons of Sichuan peppercorns into a dry pan over medium heat. Stir frequently for 1–2 minutes, until they become aromatic (be careful not to scorch them). Remove from heat, allow to cool briefly, then grind or crush. Set aside half for later use. 

2. Warm 2 tablespoons of neutral oil in a heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Pat the 1 kg beef cheeks dry and season lightly if you wish (bearing in mind the saltiness of Doubanjiang and black beans). Sear the beef in batches, ensuring you don’t overcrowd the pan. Transfer browned beef to a plate or bowl. If there is a large amount of rendered fat, skim off any excess now.

3. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the grated ginger, crushed garlic cloves, and white parts of the scallions into the same pot. Gently cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring frequently.

4. Stir in 2 tablespoons Doubanjiang and 1 tablespoon fermented black beans. Cook for 1–2 minutes.  Add 1 tablespoon chilli powder (or to taste). Toast briefly in the oil for 30 seconds.

5. If the pot looks dry, drizzle in a little more oil or reserved beef fat. Sprinkle in 2 tablespoons plain flour, stirring continuously. Add 1 tablespoon of the ground Sichuan peppercorns. Stir and cook for 1–2 minutes.

6. Gradually add cold water or stock (start with about 300 ml), stirring as you pour to avoid clumping.
Keep adding liquid in small increments—up to 800 ml total—until you reach a consistency that’s pourable but still thick. Stir in the 1 tablespoon light soy sauce and 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce. Add 2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine. Taste and adjust seasoning.

7. Return the browned beef (1 kg) to the pot. Add enough water or stock to just cover the meat if needed. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover with a lid, and cook on low heat for about 3 hours, or until the beef is very tender. Check occasionally, topping up with a bit more liquid if it becomes too thick.

8. Once the meat is fork-tender, carefully remove it from the pot (it may start to fall apart). Increase the heat to medium and reduce the sauce until it coats the back of a spoon. Taste again, adjusting salt or soy sauce as necessary. Stir in 1 teaspoon of Chinese black vinegar (or balsamic) for subtle acidity—just enough to balance, without making the dish taste vinegary. Return the beef to the pot to reheat briefly in the thickened sauce.

9. Sprinkle the remaining toasted Sichuan peppercorns over the dish. Top with the green parts of the scallions. 

10. Serve on a plate, because you can.
