Ingredients
Yield:6 to 8 servings

    3(15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained
    ⅔cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
    3(14½-ounce) cans diced tomatoes
    ¾teaspoon ground cinnamon
    4marjoram sprigs or 3 oregano sprigs, plus leaves for garnish
    2½tablespoons peeled, finely chopped ginger
    Salt and black pepper
    2(3- to 4-pound) kabocha, butternut or koginut squash
    ¾cup full-fat plain Greek yogurt (one 5-ounce container)


Preparation

    Step 1

    Heat the oven to 300 degrees with racks in the upper and lower thirds. On a sheet pan, stir together the chickpeas, ⅔ cup olive oil, tomatoes, cinnamon, marjoram sprigs and 2 tablespoons chopped ginger. Season with salt and pepper and spread in an even layer.
    Step 2

    Scrub the squash — the skin is perfectly edible — and prick the squash in a few places with a paring knife. Transfer to an oven-safe skillet, baking dish or a second sheet pan (line with foil for easier clean-up) and coat lightly with oil, salt and pepper.
    Step 3

    Bake the squash on the bottom rack and the chickpeas on the upper rack until a knife slides easily through the squash and the chickpeas and tomatoes are dark red and thick like jam, 2 to 2½ hours, stirring the chickpeas occasionally.
    Step 4

    Meanwhile, stir the remaining ½ tablespoon ginger into the yogurt. Stir in water until thin enough to drizzle, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
    Step 5

    Discard the herb sprigs, then season the chickpeas to taste with salt and pepper. When the squash are cool enough to handle, cut or tear into big pieces, then scoop out and discard the stems, seeds and stringy bits. Season the squash with salt and pepper. Transfer the squash to a platter flesh side up, then top with the chickpeas, some of the ginger yogurt and a sprinkle of marjoram leaves. Serve the remaining yogurt alongside.
