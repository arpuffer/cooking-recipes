## Ingredients

* 16 guajillo chiles also called chile cascabel ancho
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1/4 cup chopped cilantro
* 3 to 4 cups water
* 2 tablespoons cooking oil
* salt to taste

## Instructions
1. Remove the stems, seeds, and veins from the chiles. Discard.
2. Peel the cloves of garlic.
3. Chop the cilantro. You can use the stems.
4. Put all the ingredients in a pan.
5. Add just enough water to cover the ingredients, about 4 cups.
6. Bring the water to a boil then reduce the heat to low.
7. Simmer for 1 minute then turn off the heat.
8. Allow the ingredients to soak for 15 minutes. The dried chiles will reconstitute at this time.
9. Pour all of the ingredients including 2 cups the soaking water into the blender.
10. Blend until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add a little water if needed to blend.
11. Strain the mixture into mixing a bowl. Discard the paste that remains in the strainer.
12. Heat 2 tablespoons of cooking oil in your saucepan over medium heat then add the strained salsa and 1 tsp. salt.
13. Turn the heat to low. Add up to a cup of soaking water to get the desired consistency. 
14. Simmer the salsa for 30 minutes until it thickens. The salsa will darken in color during this time.
15. Taste the salsa and add salt if needed to get the desired taste.

## Notes
The flavor of the salsa will deepen if you let is rest for a few hours before serving.
If you find the salsa to be too bitter for your tastes, add 1 tablespoon of sugar to reduce the bitterness.
This salsa freezes well. Portion it in freezer bags and it will keep for up to 2 months in the freezer.
