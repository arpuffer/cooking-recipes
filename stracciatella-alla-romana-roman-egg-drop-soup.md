# Stracciatella Alla Romana (Roman Egg Drop Soup)

Ingredients
Yield:About 6 servings

    ¼cup extra-virgin olive oil
    2medium yellow onions, diced
    Kosher salt
    6large eggs
    ½cup finely grated fresh Parmesan, rind reserved, plus more for serving
    Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
    Freshly ground black pepper
    8cups chicken stock, preferably homemade
    2tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley

Preparation

    Step 1

    Set a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high heat. Add oil. When it shimmers, add the onions and a generous pinch of salt. Reduce heat to medium. Stirring occasionally, cook onions for 10 to 15 minutes until tender. It’s fine if they start to take on a little color.
    Step 2

    In a large measuring cup or medium bowl with a spout, thoroughly whisk together the eggs, ½ cup grated Parmesan, nutmeg, black pepper, and a generous pinch of salt.
    Step 3

    When onions are tender, add Parmesan rind and stock to pot. Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce to a strong simmer. While gently whisking soup with one hand, pour egg mixture into pot in a thin stream with the other. Once all of the egg mixture has been added, turn off the heat. Remove Parmesan rind. Taste and adjust for salt.
    Step 4

    Ladle soup into bowls and serve immediately, garnished with Parmesan, black pepper, and parsley.
