# Chorizo Breakfast Tacos
Makes enough filling for 3-4 tacos

Ingredients:
* 3 Tortillas
* 2 eggs
* 2-3 heaping tablespoons of cooked (leftover) chorizo.  I used vegan soy, but meat-types will taste even better)
* A dash of each of the following seasonings:
  * Sazon / Adobo
  * Salt
  * Cumin
  * Smoked paprika
  * Chili powder
  * Fresh cracked black peppercorn
* Toppings:
  * Whole milk yogurt (crema fresca or sour cream would be more appropriate, but whatever)
  (suggested toppings: thin sliced radishes, cilantro, pico de gallo, salsa, etc. The world is your oyster--I mean, don't use oysters--but I just put a dollop of yogurt)

Steps:
1. Scramble 2 eggs in a bowl with a pinch of salt
2. Heat oil pretty durn (not smoking) hot in a skillet--like you're doing fried eggs, not the soft scrambled type.  Hot enough that the bottom of the egg insta-cooks in the oil before touching the metal.  This will help with cleanup.
3. Toss in all of the seasonings
4. Once egg is fully cooked, add the chorizo.  Raw meat chorizo is an orange paste, and once cooked doesn't look very different--definitely sketches me out.  So I went with already-cooked crumbles
5. Toast/warm/steam the tortillas
6. chuck the egg/chorizo mix in, add toppings, and enjoy!
