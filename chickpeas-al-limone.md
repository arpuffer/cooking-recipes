Ingredients
Yield:4 servings

    5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling 

    2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

    3 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, undrained

    1 tablespoon lemon zest (from 1 large or 2 small lemons)

    ¼ cup lemon juice (from 1 large or 2 small lemons)

    1 cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for topping

    Salt and pepper

    8 ounces burrata, drained

    Handful basil leaves

    Sourdough or baguette, for serving


Preparation

    Step 1

    Heat a deep, medium skillet or pot over medium-high. When hot, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil; add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds. Stir in the chickpeas and their brine, then bring to the boil. Let the brine bubble rapidly until it has reduced and thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low, add the lemon zest and stir for 1 minute. 
    Step 2

    Meanwhile, to a large bowl, add the lemon juice, Parmesan and the remaining ¼ cup of olive oil.
    Step 3

    Add the chickpeas and the reduced brine to the Parmesan-lemon mixture and stir continuously until the cheese has melted and the sauce is thick but still loose. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
    Step 4

    To serve, divide among bowls and drizzle with more olive oil. Tear the burrata over the top and sprinkle with the basil leaves and more Parmesan. Serve with bread.
